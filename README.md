# 🚀 SOFTWARE TESTING Practice Platform  Selenium 

> 🔗 **Live Website:*https://softwaretestingpro.netlify.app/*

This project is built for practicing and demonstrating Selenium automation testing skills using JavaScript.  
It is designed to simulate real-world UI testing scenarios including navigation flows, form validation, element interaction, and end-to-end browser automation.  
The platform helps in strengthening DOM handling, selectors strategy, waits, assertions, and test case structuring.  
Ideal for beginners and intermediate testers who want hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver and JavaScript-based automation frameworks.
